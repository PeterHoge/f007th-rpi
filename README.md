### Overview
The main goal of this project is to intercept and decode radio signals from temperature/humidity sensors and show on console or send this received data to REST/[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) servers and/or [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker.
It is also possible to retrieve the current values via HTTP and even get some HTML pages. 
[Support of MQTT](https://github.com/alex-konshin/f007th-rpi/wiki/Support-of-MQTT) is still experimental. If you want to help to test this new feature then please contact the developer.

The utility can send data to InfluxDB server or virtually any REST server that supports PUT requests.\
For example, REST server can be [LoopBack](https://loopback.io/) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for storing data.
But I prefer to send data to [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) server and visualize it with [Grafana](http://grafana.org/).  

You can view in any web browser the latest data received from sensors and graph of temperatures for the last 24 hours.\
This functionality does not require installing any servers because it uses built-in HTTP server.

You can assign action to some events. Actions may be changed accordingly to the specified schedule and can be enabled/disabled by other actions.

### Supported receivers
The data is received with cheap RF 433.92MHz receivers like [RXB6](https://cdn.instructables.com/ORIG/FM6/PYJR/JUMXMMGB/FM6PYJRJUMXMMGB.pdf), [SeeedStudio RF-R-ASK](https://www.seeedstudio.com/433MHz-ASK%26amp%3BOOK-Super-heterodyne-Receiver-module-p-2205.html), RX-RM-5V, etc.
It is tested with RXB6 and SeeedStudio RF-R-ASK.
